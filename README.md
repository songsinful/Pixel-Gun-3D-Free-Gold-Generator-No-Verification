Pixel Gun 3D is a fast-paced, action-packed shooting game for the Nintendo Wii's popular console. The game comes with many different types of weapons, each with its own unique use. You will use your Wii Remote Plus to shoot the enemies as they approach you. Your aim is to destroy as many targets as possible in the minimum amount of time. The game is suitable for those who enjoy frantic, action-packed shooting games. Pixel Gun features a story that follows the main character, Pixel uses his newly-acquired eye power to see the enemy before they attack. The player controls Pixel by means of the Wii remote. Shooting starts by aiming the weapon at the screen. A circular motion will give you a chance to aim and fire.

You can also move the screen to the left or right to change the angle of the target you are aiming at. The game has no other objectives except to kill as many enemies as possible within the shortest amount of time possible. The various settings allow the game to be played in various scenarios. There is a short level with a few basic weapons and enemy types, a slightly difficult level where you need to get as many items collected as possible, and the hardest of the lot which requires good reflexes and strategic thinking to win.Pixel Gun 3D Hack Coins and Gold 

Pixel Gun 3D is not entirely story-based. Although some of the missions require using weapons and destroying targets, there are many that are purely action-packed. It's easy to get bored with the storyline and it can get tedious completing all the objectives. The controls for the game can be difficult to learn and are frustrating at times. You earn money for destroying targets. Some weapons cannot be destroyed by the first shot. Other weapons have special abilities like a shield. This shield cannot be destroyed by a single shot. In this case, it is best to move close to the enemy so that they are forced to come to you and thus give up their cover. Always make sure you have aimed at the center of their line of fire.

Aiming your weapon is quite simple. Just hold down the trigger and squeeze the trigger. When you shoot the gun, it will go where you want it to go. The game can be very addictive. You will get frustrated when you see your targets getting destroyed by one shot and then done with them. The overall graphics of the game are not great but it does its job well. It can be pretty boring playing from a flat background. The explosions in the game look nice. The shooting looks decent. However, I would say that the actual sounds that go off when you get hit are less frequent than other games.

I enjoyed playing Pixel Gun. It starts out easy enough and gets progressively more challenging the further in the game you progress. Even though I started off using only the shotgun, the game allows you to use all of the weapons so you can play it how you want to.
